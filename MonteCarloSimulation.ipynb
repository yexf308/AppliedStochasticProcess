        "# What is a Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
        "A Monte Carlo simulation is a type of computational algorithm that estimates the probability of occurrence of an undeterminable event due to the involvement of random variables. The algorithm relies on repeated random sampling in an attempt to determine the probability. This means simulating an event with random inputs a large number of times to obtain your estimation. You can determine other factors as well, and we will see that in the example. Monte Carlo simulations can be utilized in a broad range of fields spanning from economics, gambling, engineering, energy, and anything in-between. So, no matter what career field you are in, it’s an excellent thing to know about.\n"

We said our number of rolls per game is 1,000, and the amount the player will be betting each roll is $1. In addition to our input variables, we need to define how many times we want to simulate the game. We can use the num_simulations variable as our Monte Carlo simulation count. The higher we make this number, the more accurate the predicted probability is to its true value.\n",

For this example, we will track the win probability (wins per game divided by the total number of rolls) and ending balance for each simulation (or game). These are initialized as lists and will be updated at the end of each game.\n",

If the dice are the same number, we add 4 times the bet to the balance list and add a win to the win count. If the dice are different, we subtract the bet from the balance list. At the end of each roll, we add a count to our num_rolls list.\n",

Finally, we can plot the num_rolls and balance variables to add a line to the figure we defined earlier."
